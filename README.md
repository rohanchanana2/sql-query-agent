# LangChain SQL Query Agent with ChatGroq

This project demonstrates the integration of LangChain's SQL utilities and ChatGroq, a language model, to create an intelligent agent that can generate and execute SQL queries based on natural language user inputs. The application interacts with a PostgreSQL database to retrieve and process data.

## Features

- **Natural Language to SQL**: Convert user questions into SQL queries.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Execute queries directly on a PostgreSQL database.
- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Leverage the ChatGroq model for structured output and dynamic query generation.
- **State Management**: Maintain the application state for questions, queries, results, and answers.
